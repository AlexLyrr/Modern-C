We read in the description of fgets():

"Reads characters from stream and stores them as a C string into str until (num-1) characters have been read or either a newline or the end-of-file is reached, whichever happens first."

So we read 32 characters at a time up to the encounter of a newline. That is if we have the following line, it will be read in 2 subsequent calls:

"0123456789012345678901234567890123456789\n"
|------------- call 1 -----------||-call 2-|
